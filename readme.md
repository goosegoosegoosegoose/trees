# What I did
- made trees
- regular trees with a children array was fairly simple
- binary trees I bumbled through
- fairly sure the 2 complex tree tests for maxSum in binary-tree exercise is wrong.
  - if you add the nodes up individually its what my function gets. They're short a few. Unless I made a mistake.
